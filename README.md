This gem interfaces with the Sumo Logic [Search Job API](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumo-api-doc/wiki/search-job-api).
It may be used through native Ruby, or via a CLI that has been provided.

## Installation

From the command line:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install sumo-search
```

From your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'sumo-search'
```

## Configuration

Your credentials go into the YAML file `~/.sumo_creds`.
An example YAML file is listed below:

```yaml
backend:
  email: email@test.net
  password: trustno1
default:
  email: email2@test.net
  password: test-pass
```

The credentials in the `default` namespace are loaded by default.
To change this, set `ENV['SUMO_CREDENTIAL']` to the credential that you would like to load.

## Ruby Usage

To create a search job from ruby, the `Sumo.search` method is provided.
For example, the following creates a search job for everything from the 2014-01-01:

```ruby
search = Sumo.search(
  query: '*',
  from: '2014-01-01T00:00:00',
  to: '2014-01-01T23:59:59',
  time_zone: 'UTC'
)
```

To iterate through the messages returned by the API, use the `#messages` method on the object returned by `Sumo.search`.

```ruby
search.messages.each { |message| puts message }
```

Similarly, iterating through the records can be acheived through the `#records` method.

```ruby
search.records.each { |record| puts record }
```

Note that the two above methods lazily grab the results in chunks, so iterating through these will take some time.
The difference between records and messages is described at the bottom of [this section](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumo-api-doc/wiki/search-job-api#wiki-getting-the-current-search-job-status) of the api docs.

## CLI Usage

The executable packaged with this gem is called `sumo`.

sumo --query '*' --from '2014-01-01T00:00:00' --to '2014-01-01T23:59:59' --time-zone 'UTC'

sumo --query 'StagingFitness' --from '2013-01-01T00:00:00' --to '2014-01-01T00:00:00' --time-zone 'UTC' --extract-key 'message'
```
